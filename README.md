What I was able to get done

I was able to get and pull a lot of the same images thwarted on the site, into my own App Landing assignment. From the icons and the images of the covers, I was able to go through and find pretty much the exact one. Though a couple may be slightly tweaked, there's a couple of variant covers that are kinda identical, but I think I was careful with the ones I picked.
I was able to organize in a similar vein, with the header up top, and the big promotional area, along with the ip tabs, and then the other promotions and latest news in drops, and then the various categories of selections that were had on the site, and down to the newsletter section and info that's usually on the bottom.
I was able to get some sort of categorizing done, as with the different categories I had looked up how to create and form tables, and was able to use that to be able to arrange the covers of the books and comics, with their general names and such and series.
Got the colors to match the aesthetic that was on the actual website.


Couldn’t do
I wasn’t able to get any external links onto the site, as that would have been a lot of work to get every single book,comic, apparel, whatever to match an icon. There is a lot that you can buy.
No search bar functionality or anything like that
Having the images move, I think it was referred to as a carousel, but where it's kind of like a slideshow and they swap out for one another as you are on the site.
There are some spacing issues that I need to try and fix, even with the use of the table system I implemented, some items are just kinda off
There's a type of hover, where if you hover your mouse over an item it can change to a different photo
Quick View pop ups, to make the images on the page bigger, without actually taking you to a different webpage altogether, kinda like a popup. Slime images also got like a zoom and drag feature as well
The hader always following and staying in frame, so that you can still have the option to switch to a different page, so you don't have to scroll up.
